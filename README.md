# 🏓 Deploying a Ping Pong Game using AWS CI/CD Tools (CodeBuild + CodePipeline + ECS + ECR)

## 📄 Project Description

This project focuses on setting up a **CI/CD pipeline** for deploying a Dockerized version of the **2048 Ping Pong Game** to AWS. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the game to a scalable infrastructure using:

- **Amazon ECS**
- **Amazon ECR**
- **AWS CodePipeline**

### 🔧 Key Tasks

- 🐳 Build and push a Docker image of the Ping Pong game to **Amazon ECR**  
- 🔁 Set up a **CodePipeline** to automate the build and deploy process  
- 🚀 Deploy the Dockerized game to **Amazon ECS** using the **Fargate** launch type

### 🎯 What You'll Learn

By completing this project, you'll understand how to integrate various AWS services to create a streamlined **CI/CD workflow**, reducing manual intervention and enabling faster, more reliable application deployment.
